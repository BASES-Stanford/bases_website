        p E-Bootcamp is an intensive international conference designed specifically to target and strip away all of the potential weaknesses of our Bootcampersâ€™ ideas and reforge them, ready for launch. 
        p Our demanding program includes pitching and design workshops, marketing initiatives, media rundowns, sector-specific critiquing, and mentoring sessions with our all-star sponsors and partners. 
        p During the conference, Bootcampers will have the opportunity to present their products in a competitive environment, including a product showcase and pitch competition, attended by investors and Silicon Valley stalwarts.  The four best entrepreneurs, chosen by our panel of esteemed judges, will be chosen to receive a grand prize package, offering them the tools they need to establish their startups.
