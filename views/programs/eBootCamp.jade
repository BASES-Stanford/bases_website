        p The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students is proud to present the 2013 edition of Entrepreneurial Bootcamp. Held at Stanford University, April 18th-21st, E-Bootcamp is an intensive conference designed specifically to target and strip away all of the potential weaknesses of our Bootcampersâ€™ ideas and reforge them, ready for launch. Our demanding program includes pitching and design workshops, marketing initiatives, media rundowns, sector-specific critiquing, and mentoring sessions with our all-star sponsors and partners.
        p During the conference, our Bootcampers will have the opportunity to present their products in a competitive environment, including a product showcase and pitch competition, attended by investors and Silicon Valley stalwarts.  The four best entrepreneurs, chosen by our panel of esteemed judges, will be chosen to receive a grand prize package, offering them the tools they need to establish their startups. 
        p If you have any questions, or are an established entrepreneur or businessperson and would like to participate in the conference as a speaker or sponsor, you can contact us at ebootcamp.info@gmail.com.
