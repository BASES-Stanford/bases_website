          p The structure of BASES Challenge is slightly different from that of previous years.
          p This year, Challenge has been consolidated into one comprehensive competition. As such, all applicants will submit the same application.
          p Each teams will be judged on a holistic set of criteria, making ALL teams eligible to win in the “Best Overall Venture” category. Additionally, each team will be judged on a non-inclusive separate set of judging criteria focused on the venture’s social impact.  Top scoring teams in the social category will have the opportunity to give a separate pitch at Finale for the “Best Social Venture” prize.
          p Teams who are entered into both pitching rounds at Finale (Overall and Social) will have the opportunity to compete for both prizes. In the event a team wins in both categories, they will only receive the larger of the two prize amounts.

          h6 Kickoff
          p Held in January, the Kickoff event introduces the BASES Challenge competition to the Stanford community in an exciting way. At the event, Stanford students hear from a keynote speaker, interact with our past finalists in a demo-day style setting, meet with sponsors, and find potential team members. Last year’s keynote speaker was Michael Baum, Founder and CEO of Founder.org. There were 275 total attendees at last year’s Kickoff.

          h6 Online Feedback Forum
          p A new initiative, the online feedback forum will give Stanford entrepreneurs the chance to share and critique each other’s ideas, prototypes, and business plans. This will get more students excited about the Challenge competition and help them form dynamic teams.

          h6 Judging Rounds
          p After teams submit applications for the BASES Challenge startup competition, they pitch their projects to sponsors at several judging rounds. The first judging round gives Challenge teams a chance to obtain valuable feedback on their projects. 108 teams were selected to participate in the first judging round last year, with 51 teams advancing to the second judging round at Finale.

          h6 Workshops
          p Workshops give Challenge participants opportunities to improve skills in key areas that are essential to entrepreneurial projects. Last year, 50 Challenge participants attended a pitching workshop with Chris Lipp, author of The Startup Pitch: A Proven Formula to Win Funding. This year we are looking to incorporate more workshops on topics like needfinding, prototyping, and business plans.

          h6 Office Hours
          p Office hours give Challenge teams a chance to gain constructive feedback on their projects from industry experts and fellow Challenge participants. About 40 Challenge teams participated in office hours last year.

          h6 Finale
          p Finale is the final event in the BASES Challenge competition, where teams showcase their startups to the public and the prize money winners are determined. BASES Challenge awards a total of $100,000 in prize money each year. In addition to public demos and the final judging round, attendees have the chance to listen to a keynote speaker talk about his or her experiences with entrepreneurship. Past winners include Kiva, One Acre Fund, Boosted Boards, D.Light Design, and Samasource.

          h6 <a href = 'https://audacyspace.com/'> Audacy </a> - 1st Place
          p Audacy solves the communication problem for the commercial space industry.
          p Currently, each space company builds its own ground stations to communicate with its spacecraft. However geography and politics mean that no matter how many ground stations are built, 30% earth coverage is the maximum achievable limit.
          p It is clear that communications is currently the bottleneck of the commercial space industry. Apart from their expense, ground stations cannot handle anywhere near the data rate generated by modern spacecraft, which for earth-imaging satellites can be terabytes of data every day. Timeliness of data is critical for many companies, so the >70% blackout time represents a significant loss of revenue.
          p Audacy’s constellation of relay satellites provides 100% continuous coverage of all earth-moon space to client spacecraft. It uses the latest wireless multi-access technology to serve high data rates to hundreds of simultaneous users, negating ground stations and removing barriers of entry to the space industry. Companies simply buy a Verizon-style data subscription plan, install an Audacy-approved radio on their spacecraft, and their communications are sorted.
          p There is no doubt that this great consumer need for continuous spacecraft communication will eventually be satisfied, it is simply a question of when and by whom.

          h6 <a href = '#'> Aperture Medical </a> - 2nd Place
          p End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects more than 2 million men, women, and children worldwide. For these patients, renal-replacement therapy is a life-sustaining treatment and reliable access to the bloodstream for hemodialysis is their lifeline. Arteriovenous fistulas and grafts – surgically created connections between arteries and veins in the extremities – constitute the most prevalent and best options for hemodialysis access. However, due to scarring and narrowing of the blood vessels, these connections frequently fail within months and only 50-60% of connections last a full year. This translates to further invasive procedures, hospitalizations, and riskier modes of dialysis access for patients and a substantial economic burden to the healthcare system.
          p Our team aims to address this problem by targeting the most upstream biological event in the development blood vessel narrowing or stenosis. By targeting the root cause of stenosis, we aim to significantly improve the short and long-term patency of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts for patients with ESRD. Our solution is a one-time intervention at the time of creation that integrates easily into existing surgical procedures and leverages new scientific insights into vascular biology. With this novel approach we aim to bring innovation to this truly unmet clinical need.

          h6 <a href = 'http://www.xstreamtrucking.com/'> XStream </a> - 3rd Place
          p Long haul trucks have a gap between the tractor and the trailer and this is a significant driver of aerodynamic drag. 2/3rd of fuel spent at highway speed is spent overcoming aerodynamic drag and therefore every little bit of savings help. Overall smoothing over this gap saves 3-5% of fuel costs for trucks (confirmed by CFD and wind tunnel tests).
          p The gap exists to allow trucks to turn, but this ability is not required at high speeds. Therefore our device deploys at high speed to cover the gap and retracts when the truck is going slower. This allows us to achieve fuel savings on the highway without compromising on the trucks’ maneuverability at low speed.
          p Our product has a fully granted patent and a full scale prototype. As one of the most efficient fleets, Walmart recognizes this problem and is excited to test our product. They have offered to pay for extensive, scientific, controlled road tests of our prototype in early April.

          h6 <a href = '#'> EVIMED </a> - 1st Place
          p Over 15% of patients undergoing central venous catheterization (CVC) have complications, including mechanical, infectious and thrombotic events. Nearly 5-15% of patients with CVC experience central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). It is the most common nosocomial (in-hospital) infection and results in prolonged length of stay (from 5-20 days), significant morbidity and an increase in crude mortality (from 12-25%). CVC infections remain common in the U.S., with over 80,000 CLABSIs each year. Most efforts to reduce CLABSI involve behavior modifications to mitigate patient risk during CVC insertion and maintenance - these behavior modifications fall short of solving the problem. A thoughtless solution is needed to eliminate this serious infection, save lives, and reduce wasteful spending.
          p We have developed a port protector device (EVIMED) that attaches to a needleless connector on a catheter hub. This port protector provides effortless sterilization releasing a combination of alcohol and chlorohexidine upon connection.The EVIMED eliminates the need for behavioral modification. Initial testing demonstrates our product will lower infections by over 50%! We have filed for a provisional patent, and the Stanford Vascular access team is excited to run a trial this Summer.        p We have developed a port protector device (EVIMED) that attaches to a needleless connector on a catheter hub.

          p Across East Africa, private-sector health clinics and pharmacies play a critical, frontline role in providing medical care to millions of patients. In Kenya alone, there are more than 6,000 private pharmaceutical outlets that serve as the first and often only point of care for patients and act as a stopgap to the public healthcare system, where drug stockouts occur an estimated 68% of the time.
          p The supply chains that serve these pharmacies, however, are highly fragmented, and it is estimated that 20-45% of medicine sold in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia is counterfeit or substandard. This results in an estimated 700,000 deaths and $1.6 billion in diverted revenue yearly. These ineffective supply chains, combined with poor information on drug quality and operational inefficiencies, also lead to inflated costs and threaten the quality of care provided to patients .
          p Miti Health addresses these challenges by (1) providing an Android-based smartphone and tablet platform for healthcare providers; (2) certifying high-quality distributors of medication; and (3) building a recognizable brand to strengthen the market power of pharmacists. This integrated system expands patients’ access to affordable, quality healthcare, reduces counterfeit medications sold in East Africa, and provides better information for customers and healthcare providers.

          h6 <a href = '#'> Spectrum </a> - 2nd Place (Tie)
          p Buildings consume significant amounts of energy and are the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. Despite this demand on the environment, current architectural practice lacks tools that effectively inform architects of the life cycle environmental impact and cost implications of design decisions. The absence of analytical feedback on design decisions early in the design process require architecture firms to spend $2.8 annually on rework costs. Left without an integrated design assessment solution, the architecture industry will continue to waste money as well as be the single greatest contributor to global carbon emissions.
          p Spectrum is a software platform that provides automated feedback on architectural design decisions by seamlessly integrating with architect’s current design environment. The software plugs in to 3D building information modeling software and integrates cloud processing, computational algorithms, and a building materials database with life cycle assessment, costing, maintenance, and energy simulation software.
          p The algorithms quickly compute the carbon and cost performance of many design alternatives for various design parameters. An interactive dashboard provides sustainability metrics and allows real-time visualization of the current design’s performance relative to the alternatives. Ultimately the software enables architects to efficiently make decisions that meet their sustainability and budget goals.

          p Spinal fusion is a widely-performed and increasingly prevalent surgical technique used to alleviate spinal instabilities and deformities. In the established paradigm, a pedicle probe is used to create the trajectory that a vertebral screw follows. It can be difficult to achieve a stable, or even safe, trajectory, so this technique is most often performed under fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance resulting in radiation exposure 10-12 times greater than other musculoskeletal procedures. Of the approximately 500,000 spinal fusion surgeries performed annually in the U.S., over 20% of vertebral screws are misplaced, necessitating reoperations in 1 to 5% of all patients. Misplaced screws can cause an array of complications from tearing arteries or intestines to damaging nerve tissue which may result in partial or complete paralysis.
          p Our team has developed a low-cost, smarter pedicle probe, AccuSpine for the accurate placement of vertebral screws. Using an electromechanical method, AccuSpine continuously measures changes in force coupled with a path-identification algorithm to provide real-time navigational guidance for the surgeon, keeping the probe within the bone. Our team aims to reduce screw breach rates, operating room time and radiation exposure, therefore limiting the cost of the procedure while enhancing safety for both patients and doctors.

          h6 <a href = 'https://www.edentech.co/'> Eden </a> - Enterprise Category
          p Eden is solving the powerful consumer frustration related to technology installation and maintenance at the home. It is a hassle to install consumer electronics (e.g., TV mounting) and frustrating to repair and maintain it when it malfunctions (e.g., computer viruses). Further, there are currently no customer-oriented, on demand providers of tech support to turn to, as Geek Squad has a 1.5 star rating on Yelp! due to terrible customer service (despite having $2+ billion in sales).
          p As such, we built Eden, which provides on demand tech support for consumers. We have a platform of vetted, 5-star tech contractors who come right to the consumer, whenever they are needed. We are offering the traditional Geek Squad services using an Uber contractor model, and also have newer services related to home automation / internet of things. We are post-pilot / post-revenue and recently raised $100K+ of venture funding from a leading venture capital firm in Silicon Valley.

          p Video recording devices are now ubiquitous. As smartphones, GoPros, and DSLRs record our lives in high definition, we can get so caught up in capturing a moment that we often forget to enjoy the moment while it’s happening. More often than not, our videos don’t come out as we intend. Subjects are out of frame or the footage is not good quality, making even a mountain biking adventure for example turn out to be unwatchable. In our selfie generation, if we want to be in our own videos we have to have another person shooting the footage. Even professional camera operators have trouble tracking moving subjects while they themselves are moving.
          p Camtron is an intelligent and personal robotic cameraman. Camtron stabilizes your camera about 3 axes and intelligently tracks subjects using our advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms without the use of a beacon. Simply identify a subject using our app, and our system will stay locked-on, even if it is in motion or the subject is obstructed momentarily. Camtron produces effortlessly smooth footage of your experience and leaves you free to enjoy without the hassle or worry that comes with other products.

          p Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms. The disease leads to episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and coughing​. Some people are able to control the disease and avoid severe exacerbations via existing therapies and the use of “asthma action plans,” but people with moderate or severe persistent asthma​ have difficulty doing so and frequently utilize costly health care services. One problem is that the action plans have relatively subjective criteria that rely on late signs of exacerbations. There is a need for more accurate, objective indicators of asthma status to enable families of pediatric asthma patients to better control the disease, ​analogous to the way glucometers enable a primarily home-­based control of diabetes.
          p Our innovation is a system for early detection of asthma exacerbations. It employs passive nighttime monitoring of physiologic parameters of an asthmatic patient and environmental factors combined with personalized analytics to provide early detection of an exacerbation. The information provided by the system can be used by patients and providers working under the framework of an asthma action plan to initiate the use of proven therapeutics that can alleviate the severity of the exacerbation.
