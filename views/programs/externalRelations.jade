          h4 BASES Startup Career Fair
          p Every January, BASES hosts Stanfordâ€™s second largest career fair, attracting 1,000+ students and 70 companies. The fair attracts top programmers and engineers and is the only Stanford career fair focused on startups.
          p Companies that attend the BASES Startup Career Fair will also have access to our resume talent portal, post jobs and opportunities on our entrepreneurship email newsletter, the BASES Digest, reaching over 5,000 people.


          h4 Startup Lunches
          p Our External Relations team invites the founders and CEOs from sponsor companies to have lunch with high-quality, pre-selected students in intimate, high-impact settings. Past guests include Joe Lonsdale and Kevin Hartz, and past companies represented include Palantir, Thumbtack, ZenPayroll, and AdRoll. This is a fantastic opportunity for students to get to know companies on a more personal level.
