        p The Social E-Challenge program awards teams with exceptional ideas that generate positive social impact. Competition categories include health, education, economic development, and sustainability. Social-E especially encourages teams with products or ideas containing large-scale potential.
        p Similar to E-Challenge, the Social-E program consists of three rounds of judging. Advancing teams are paired with a social innovator, VC, or professor as a mentor and participate in accelerator workshops. The first round of judging emphasizes the idea and vision. 
        p As teams progress through the program, they are aided in refining their business model to emphasize sustainability and social impact. The final round is a public event and is judged by prominent names in social entrepreneurship.
        p Last year Social-E had 90 competing teams. Previous winners have included Kiva, One Acre Fund, Samasource, Carbon Lighthouse, D. Light Design and DripTech.
