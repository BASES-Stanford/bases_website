            | The Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab is dedicated to understanding the dynamics and implications of interactions among people in the virtual reality world, such as in immersive virtual reality simulations as well as other forms of digital representations in media, communication systems and games. The lab uses tools and techniques such as behavior science methodologies and three-dimensional modeling techniques in order to understand important social questions on the interface between real and virtual human interaction, as well as the potential for these kinds of virtual, simulated interactions to improve everyday life.
