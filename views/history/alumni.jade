              p Guido Appenzeller was involved in BASES in the first years of its existence. He describes his BASES involvement as pivotal for his later life and credits BASES for launching his entrepreneurial career at Stanford. Through BASES he enjoyed meeting entrepreneurs who had successfully launched start-ups and he learned many of the details involved in founding and running a company. In 2002 he participated in the BASES E-Challenge, which led to him co-founding Voltage Security. He stayed with Voltage Security as co-founder and CTO until 2008, helping to grow it to profitability and over 1,000 enterprise customers. After a two-year stay at Stanford from 2008 to 2010 he left again to start Big Switch Networks, a networking start-up that has raised over $45M in venture capital today. Guido enjoys start-up life for the opportunity to change the world, to compete and build something out of nothing. In 2014 Guido left Big Switch and joined VMWare as Chief Technology Strategy Officer of the NSBU.

              p Ron Gutman is the current founder and CEO of HealthTap, as well as Curator of TedX Silicon Valley. Back when he was still a Stanford student, Ron ran the BASES E-Challenge Business Plan Competition. He really appreciates that BASES introduced him to a network of individuals who have gone on to do incredible things. Clearly an innovator and visionary, Ron started researching multidisciplinary health while a graduate student at Stanford. He followed his passion and mission to innovate the healthcare field through his company HealthTap, which is now the fastest growing digital health start-up of all time. For budding entrepreneurs (like current BASES members), he suggests to learn what values are most important to you, and stick to them. Also, be prepared to act at any moment to seize the opportunity.
