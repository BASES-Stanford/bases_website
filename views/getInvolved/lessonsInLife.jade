        p The BASES Lessons in Life Series (LIL) provides opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with alumni, entrepreneurs, professors, and leaders in our community over an intimate meal. The purpose of these meals is to facilitate the exchange of candid thoughts, insights, and advice while catalyzing mentoring relationships. We hope guests will also benefit through getting to know current Stanford students much more genuinely while better understanding the student perspective. Meals are limited to 10 students and are held on the Stanford University campus. Admission to each event is through application only. If you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to reach out to us at <a href='mailto:etl-leadership@lists.stanford.edu'>etl-leadership@lists.stanford.edu</a>.
